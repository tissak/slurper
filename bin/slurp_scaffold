# Pivotal Tracker stories from them. Useful during story carding sessions
# when you want to capture a number of stories quickly without clicking
# your way through the Tracker UI.

# Note that if you include labels in stories.txt, they don't appear
# immediately in Tracker. You'll have to refresh Tracker after a few seconds
# to see them.
